## What is pickle?

Pickle is a Python library used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. It allows you to convert complex 
objects, such as lists, dictionaries, and custom classes, into a byte stream that can be stored in a file or transferred
over a network.


## Why do we use pickle?

Pickle is used to save Python objects to a file and load them back into memory. It is commonly used for tasks like 
saving model objects in machine learning, caching data, or transferring data between different Python programs.


## advantages of pickle?

- The advantages of using pickle include its simplicity and ease of use. It can handle complex data structures seamlessly,
making it convenient for storing and retrieving Python objects without having to manually convert them to a different format.


## disadvantages of pickle?

- One disadvantage of pickle is that it is specific to Python, meaning the serialized data can only be read by Python 
programs. Additionally, pickle is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data, so unpickling data from 
untrusted sources can pose security risks.


## Summary about pickle:

In summary, the pickle library in Python provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize Python objects, allowing
for easy storage and retrieval of complex data structures. While pickle offers simplicity and ease of use, it is 
important to be cautious when unpickling data from untrusted sources due to security concerns and its Python-specific 
nature.
