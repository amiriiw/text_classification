## What is TensorFlow Keras?

TensorFlow Keras is an open-source high-level neural networks API that is integrated into TensorFlow. It provides a 
user-friendly interface for building, training, and deploying deep learning models with TensorFlow as the backend.


## Why do we use TensorFlow Keras?

TensorFlow Keras simplifies the process of building neural networks by offering a user-friendly and intuitive API. It
allows developers to quickly prototype and experiment with deep learning models without needing to delve into the
lower-level details of TensorFlow.


## advantages of TensorFlow Keras?

- The advantages of using TensorFlow Keras include its ease of use, modular design, and seamless integration with 
TensorFlow. Keras provides a simple and intuitive way to build neural networks, making it accessible to both beginners 
and experienced deep learning practitioners. It also offers a wide range of pre-built layers, activations, and 
optimizers for building custom models.


## disadvantages of TensorFlow Keras?

- One potential disadvantage of TensorFlow Keras is its limited flexibility compared to directly using TensorFlow. While 
Keras simplifies the process of building neural networks, it may not offer the same level of customization and control
as working with TensorFlow at a lower level. Additionally, some advanced features or custom implementations may require 
working directly with TensorFlow.


## Summary about tensorflow keras:

In summary, TensorFlow Keras is a user-friendly high-level API for building neural networks that is integrated into 
TensorFlow. It provides a simplified interface for developing deep learning models, making it accessible to a wide range
of users. While TensorFlow Keras offers advantages such as ease of use and modularity, users should be aware of its 
limitations in terms of flexibility and customization compared to working directly with TensorFlow.
